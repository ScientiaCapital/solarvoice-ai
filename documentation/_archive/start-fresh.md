# 🚀 ELITE TEAM FRESH START STRATEGY

## Executive Decision
The legacy codebase has too many incomplete implementations. We're pivoting to a **FRESH START** strategy.

## New Plan: BUILD WHAT WORKS

### Step 1: Create Minimal Working API
```bash
# Start with just the main API
cd apps/api/src
# Focus on main.ts and app.module.ts only
```

### Step 2: Add Features Incrementally
1. Get server running
2. Add voice endpoints
3. Integrate CrewAI
4. Connect MCP servers

### Step 3: Import Working Code
- Elite Prompt Team ✅
- CrewAI Integration ✅
- MCP Servers ✅

## The Elite Team Way
**Don't fix broken code - BUILD BETTER CODE!**

We have 30 days to MVP. Let's use them wisely by building fresh, clean, and powerful code.
